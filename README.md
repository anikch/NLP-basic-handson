- Write a program to input three sentences from user and creates the corpus Example: Let’s say these 3 are your strings:S1=” India won the match” S2=” England won the cricket match” S3=” Australia won the final match” Then Corpus (list of union of all words from all strings) is: [India, England, Australia, won, the, match, cricket, final]
